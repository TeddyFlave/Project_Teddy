# Project_Teddy

Cloned Merger repo into Project_Teddy
Added notes to README file within Merger directory

Created git ignore file to ignore the Merger directory. That way I don't have to push local Merger changes into remote Project_Teddy repo
Note that local Merger changes will be pushed directly to remote Merger repo.
